No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

*-- Behind Blue Eyes*

This should be the first non-technical article of this blog and I hesitated several times before finally sitting down to write it. I hesitated because it could be harmful to pass something negative onto others but I have been drown by the urge to express myself and feelings.

I do not know what is going on with me recently but I do feel something has changed toward a bad direction. For days, I just sit there doing nothing and let the fire of passion extinguished by my laziness. One may already found that I have been sending out wechat moments at a higher frequency than ever before: because I am scared by these changes and I deadly need someone's comforts.
