## Information

This is my personal blog running on a simple [content management system](https://github.com/schrodingerzhu/blog-system) written in `rust`+`async-std`+`diesel`+`askama` and series of other wonderful crates. This is a place to keep my reflections, learning notes and diaries. 

## How to Comment

Currently, the comment system is not very handy. (It was designed to be so. Sorry for that) In order to provide your precious comments, you need to clear-sign the content using PGP tools (i.e. gpg) and submit it via the form provided at a post page.

To remove your own comment, you can just follow the instructions on my page, sign and submit another corresponding json file. Notice that the json file will expire in $5$ minutes.
